				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>Spring Lake Elementary School’s websites primary function is to serve 				
				as an informational hub to parents of the students at Spring Lake 
				Elementary.  Considering that purpose, the focus on this redesign will 
				center on usability and aesthetics, both of which are lacking in its 
				current state.  In addition, the site redesign will also provide an 
				improved web presence for the school.</p>
				<h2>Site Intent</h2>
				<p>With its many accolades and awards for excellence in education, Spring 
				Lake Elementary School’s website will be redesigned with those high 
				standards and excellence in mind.  The goal of this redesign site will be 
				to significantly improve the ease of use for site visitors.  In it’s 
				current state, finding information through the main navigation is 
				difficult and time consuming.  Through the consolidation of content and 
				organization of the navigation menu, users will be able to easily and 
				effectively access the information they are seeking in an intuitive way.  
				Spring Lake Elementary School will also have a dramatically improved 
				representation on the Internet.  Through a superior design aesthetic and 
				enhanced usability, new and repeat visitors will find the new site 
				visually appealing and highly functional.</p>
				<p>Validation errors in the current site’s code are a major problem that 
				will be addressed through the site redesign.  As of today, Spring Lake 
				Elementary School’s site contains 57 different errors in the HTML code 
				alone.  These errors can cause many problems in the future, especially 
				when site maintenance or changes are necessary.  Upon completion, Spring 
				Lake Elementary School’s site will be completely error-free.</p>
				<h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
				<p>Competition for public schools is not a common issue.  However, if 
				Spring Lake Elementary School were a private school, other local and 
				potentially regional schools would be the primary competition.  The focus 
				should be centered on the delivery of high-quality education and 
				showcasing the achievements and accolades received by the school with the 
				goal of conversion, either in the form of a completed tour sign-up or 
				contact form.</p>
				<p>With regard to Spring Lake Elementary School, analytics were broad and 
				available only for k12.fl.us, which contains all domains for most public 
				schools in the state of Florida.</p>
				<p>Of all subdomains on k12.fl.us, scps.k12.fl.us, where Spring Lake 
				Elementary School’s site is located, ranks second with 9.47% of site 
				visitors, according to alexa.com.</p>
				<p>Audience demographics indicate that the primary audience is currently 
				made up of women, 25-44 years old, who have children.  This provides some 
				support to the idea that most site visitors are parents of children in 
				attendance.  (http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/k12.fl.us#)</p>
				<p>A comparison was conducted using k12.ga.us as an example.  This domain 	
				contains the subdomains for public schools located in the state of 
				Georgia, where the audience demographics were nearly identical to that of 
				k12.fl.us. (http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/k12.ga.us#)</p>
				<h2>Targeted Audience</h2>
				<p>Based on the information discovered for the competitive analysis, the 
				target user group for Spring Lake Elementary School’s website will 
				primarily consist of mothers of students that are in attendance at Spring 
				Lake Elementary.  There is also potential for site visitors that are 
				conducting research for relocation.  Consisting of mainly women, we can 
				focus our attention to redesigning with both working and stay-at-home moms 
				with varying levels of computer proficiencies while providing a welcoming 
				feel for all family members.</p>
				<h4>User Profile #1</h4>
				<p>Cindy is a stay-at-home mom with a son just entering the second grade.  
				She drops off and picks up her son everyday from school and enjoys being 
				an active participant and contributor in school functions and field trips.  
				Cindy also serves on the PTA.  Cindy will spend an average of 2-5 hours 
				per week surfing the Internet for coupons, sales, and ideas for various 
				activities.</p>
				<h4>User Profile #2</h4>
				<p>Denise is a working mom with two kids in first and third grade.  Denise 
				gets up with the kids every morning and leave for work just after she sees 
				her kids onto the bus.  Denise works Monday-Friday, 9:00 – 4:00 and spends 
				a great deal of time on the Internet to meet the needs of her career, 
				everyday.  She is always checking her smartphone for email and other 
				work-related communications.</p>
